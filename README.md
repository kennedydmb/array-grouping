# Twig Coding Challenge

## Goal
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder.

### Example
``` 
groupArrayElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3);
// [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ] 
```

## How to Run
Node.js must be installed to run

`git clone https://github.com/kennedydmb/array-grouping`

`node arrayGrouping.js`

_OR_
